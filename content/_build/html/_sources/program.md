# Program

## Schedule
16:00 EST - 17:00 EST **Arrival and registration**, meetup, onboarding

17:00 EST - late o'clock EST **Hacking**

20:00 EST - 02:00 EST **Party and drinks**

## Concept
Come hack yourself within a creative echosystem where our latent spaces synchronize through biofeedback, generative AI and digital arts.  
Our biofeedback pipeline allows the signal from different biosensors to be broadcasted on the local Wi-Fi. Connect to the network, and turn your art into an adaptive experience, or start building on one of our installations in the space.  
Immerse yourself in the unique interplay of live-generated poetry, music, and visuals, taking inspiration from your brain state, and maybe some other lifeforms ;)  

## Stations
### CyberStoryteller
- listen to the poetry of your brain : look at b2i and then hear poetry made from your brain

- extraction of chemical elements and colors based on brain harmonicity
- generative images and poetry based on stable diffusion and GPT


### Sonification (CoCophonie)
- Use our tools to create music with biofeatures
### Latent poetry
Enhance your poetic expression through visual representations of your brain states.  

- mapping of artistic style to brain states to transform the images that are being generated based on the poetry
- generative images and poetry based on stable diffusion and GPT

### Live coding
Bring your own livecoding framework or get started with [FoxDot](https://www.foxdot.org/) (Python) or [SonicPi](https://sonic-pi.net/) (Ruby). Connect your code to one of the broadcasted OSC streams, and infuse life into your algorithms ! You can find a few bits of code [here](https://github.com/hyruuk/foxdot_play) to get started with receiving OSC in FoxDot.

### The 5th station
[ ] TODO

  
Gain a novel perspective on your creative brain, enriching your understanding of neuroscience, creativity, and AI fusion.
